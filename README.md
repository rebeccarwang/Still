# Still — A Self-Awareness Companion

** Still ** is a privacy-first self-awareness toolkit designed to support users in checking in with their mood, revisiting their personal coping strategies and affirmations, and gently reflecting on their emotional state. Journaling is an optional tool within the app’s flexible, user-led flow.

## Project Purpose & Inspiration

In my experience volunteering in mental health support, I have seen how easy it is for individuals to lose sight of what helps them in times of stress. **Still** was built with this insight: that people often know their own best strategies for self-care and resilience, but may forget them when they are most needed.

##  Work in Progress

This project is **actively in development** and is not yet complete.
It is intended as a personal learning project and a demonstration of my approach to user-centered design and privacy-first practices.

Currently, the project includes:

✅ Project scaffolding
✅ Authentication and user management setup
✅ Database schema for users and mood check-ins
✅ Early-stage frontend with mood check-in UI
✅ **User-defined preferences library**: coping strategies, affirmations, and self-care items
🟡 **Branching prompts** tailored to mood: mostly built
🟡 **Basic mood-based user flow**: initial flow logic is built and tested

Planned features:

🟡 **Optional journaling** feature
🟡 **Sentiment analysis** of journal entries
🟡 **Mismatch detection**: highlight differences between mood and sentiment
🟡 **Optional tags** for insights and trend tracking
🟡 **Weekly insights and trends**
🟡 **Full UI polish and responsive design**
